# 🌐 Link-in-Bio Website

A simple personal webpage built with **HTML** and **CSS** that showcases my name, photo, social media profiles, and favorite links — all in one clean, minimal design.

## 🧱 How It’s Made

**Tech used:**  
HTML, CSS, Google Fonts (Inter), Icons8  

I started by building the basic structure in HTML, adding a centered layout that includes my photo, name, and social icons. Then I styled the page with a custom **purple-to-pink gradient background**, rounded containers, and hover effects for the links.  
Each resource link includes a small thumbnail image aligned to the left for a visual touch.

## ⚙️ Optimizations

Later on, I refined the spacing and hover animations to make the page feel smoother.  
I also adjusted the flexbox layout so the thumbnails and text align neatly on all screen sizes.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

This project taught me how to combine structure and design to create a small but polished webpage.  
I learned how **flexbox**, **hover effects**, and **transitions** can make a static page look interactive and professional.  
It also helped me get comfortable managing images, icons, and custom fonts.
